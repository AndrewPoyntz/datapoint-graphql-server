# datapoint graphql server
Mostly for me to play with graphQL, but maybe this will become a proper (very un-official!) graphQL wrapper for Met Office DataPoint

###To run, 
check it out, & grab the dependencies:

```npm i```

then run:

```node index.js <YOUR_DATAPOINT_KEY>```

Then you'll be able to go to http://localhost:3000/graphql to test out running some queries :sunglasses:

To get your own DataPoint key head on over to http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint & register - it's free! :clap: :+1:

# datapoint graphql server
Mostly for me to play with graphQL, but maybe this will become a proper (very un-offical!) graphQL wrapper for Met Office datapoint

To run, check it out, run:
```npm i```
then:
```node index.js <YOUR_DATAPOINT_KEY>```

to get your own datapoint key head on over to http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint & register - it's free!
